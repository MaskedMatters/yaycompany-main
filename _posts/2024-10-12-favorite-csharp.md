Hello everyone, this is Matthew West, once again with another blog webpage thing. Today, we'll be talking about the different types of programming languages I've learned and how I'm going to use them. This blog might be very short and I might add to things later in the future, but anyways... here we go.

I know 3 programming languages very fluently and those are JS/TS and Python. I also know a lot of C#, HTML/CSS (if you call it a programming language), and C++. There have been many other languages that I've dabbled in but I feel don't deserve to be put on the list. Anyway, these are my languages that I feel comfortable programming in and below, we talk about how I will use them
