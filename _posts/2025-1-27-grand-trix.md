This is the official handbook of the 2024 Grand Trix Chess Olympiad, showcasing all rules and information! Make sure to come back to this guide when you have questions about the Grand Trix before creating a discussion.

## Game Types and Sections
The *Grand Trix Olympiad* is composed of two main types of Chess, *Rapid* and *Classical* matches. Both of these matches will be played over the board and online. [Chess.com](https://chess.com) will be the solution that will host our online games and various contestants will be hosting over the board matches, **if and only if** they opt in and ask to host a match. The tournament will first start by playing all Rapid matches, then all Classical matches.

### Type: Rapid Matches
Rapid matches will start with two people randomly chosen as black and white in an over the board or online game. They will both get 10 minutes on the clock with no bonus time. The rules followed on this match are stated in the [FIDE handbook](https://handbook.fide.com/chapter/E012023) on there website. In the event of a win by resignation or checkmate, the winner will recieve one olympiad point (1). In the event of a draw by agreement, stalemate, insufficient material, or insufficient captures, both contestants will recieve half an olympiad point (0.5).

After that first game, they will proceed to play a second game where the person who got the white pieces will switch to black and vice versa. The time controls, chess rules, and point awards remain the same.

### Type: Classical Matches
Classical matches will start with two people randomly chosen as black andwhite in an over the board or online game. They will both get 90 minutes, or 1 hour and 30 minutes on the clock with 20 seconds bonus time. The rules followed on this match are stated in the [FIDE handbook](https://handbook.fide.com/chapter/E012023) on there website. In the event of a win by resignation or checkmate, the winner will recieve two olympiad point (2). In the event of a draw by agreement, stalemate, insufficient material, or insufficient captures, both contestants will recieve one olympiad point (1).

After that first game, they will proceed to play a second game where the person who got the white pieces will switch to black and vice versa. The time controls, chess rules, and point awards remain the same.

### Match Bracket
As stated, all Rapid matches will first start, then we will move onto Classical matches. As an example with 3 people in the tournament, two people are chosen randomly, if there is a winner, the loser versus the person who hasn't played, the winner of that will verse the original winner. If there is a draw, the two people will keep playing until a winner is decided **BUT ONLY HALF OR ONE OLYMPIAD POINT WILL BE GIVEN** for the first match (depending on if they are playing Rapid or Classical).
