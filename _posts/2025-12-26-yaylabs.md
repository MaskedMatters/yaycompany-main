Hello everyone, new blog here! Today I am going to be talking about my new website on https://yaylabs.dev! It's a website filled with a bunch of other fun websites mostly created by AI. I do also plan on other creations like a moon and drone photography gallery and API testing.

Here are the current endpoints of the website:

|Endpoints      |Description                                                                      |
|:--------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`/alarms`      |An archive of all the wakeup alarms I've had since middle school.                |
|`/discordtime` |A Discord timestamp generator that you can use in messages.                      |
|`/getmeout`    |A landing/showcase page for my Minecraft mod.                                    |
|`/quotes`      |An AI generated page that gives quotes daily... probably rarely getting updates. |

As explained above, there are still new plans for what will be added to "yl." and there were plans to move my homelab subdomains from this website to over there... but... I think it's fine here. In the first ever blog post I also said some plans for the yaycompany.com domain but now there is new things!

So, a quick and easy way to check it out issssss, going to the dev tab on this website!
