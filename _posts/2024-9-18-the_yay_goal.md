Hello everyone, welcome to a refreshed version of [The Yay Company](https://www.yaycompany.com/), we have been hard at work thinking of a new way to conver information and I have figured it out. Our main page will talk about new projects that are being made, big announcements for things, and more. It will come in the style of these "blog" posts and it should be super cool.

We are making a surprise project that you'll find out soon enough on this website, we will be giving hints in the [Subsections](#subsections) section. I'm very excited for the future of this company.

## Matthew's Projects

I've recently been following lots of tutorials by [NetworkChuck](https://www.youtube.com/@NetworkChuck) with Docker, Kasm Workspaces, and more. My developping knowledge has excelled as I'm now 13 years old and hopefully I can really make cool projects to show off to the world.

#### Learning VueJS

I really want to learn VueJS to make more backend oriented applications so I have more control over what I can do and add to future web applications. I've been looking into Auth0 and other types of authentication things but they must use a dynamic type of website other than Jekyll (a static website generator).

It is a little weird because at first I decided to learn ReactJS but they don't allow you to just use React and you need a framework for it and everything. It was weird so I got info from other people that VueJS was fun to use once you learned.

#### Subsections

Once I create something cool with code I will make it a Yay Company subsection. Let's say, I make a really big chat application, I will put it under The Yay Company - Skribbl, or whatever I name the chat application. If I create a Javascript library that needs documentation and things, I will put it under The Yay Company Docs, like below.

|Subsection|The Yay Company URL                              |Description                                                        |
|:---------|:------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`docs`    |(https://docs.yaycompany.com/`project-name`)     |This is a docs page for coding projects.                           |
|`projects`|(https://showcases.yaycompany.com/`project-name`)|This is a page for showcasing projects that are big and cool.      |
|`news`    |(https://news.yaycompany.com)                    |This is a page for news by The Yay Company with videos and reports!|

Doesn't that table look soooooo cool... it looks like this, in markdown!
