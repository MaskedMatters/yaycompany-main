# Public Ricola Farms: Reference Manual

Welcome to the Public Ricola Farms! You’re receiving this manual because you either requested a written description of all the Public Ricola Farms or have recently completed the Public Ricola Farms: Certification of Accessibility. This guide provides a comprehensive yet easy-to-follow overview of the farms available to you. Let’s dive in!

----------

### **Enderman Farm**

**Location:** Left side of the main island in the End dimension.

**Purpose:** The Enderman Farm is designed to help you collect experience and ender pearls. It works by aggravating Endermen, causing them to try and attack you, which results in entity cramming in a small hole.

**How to Use:**

1.  Walk to the end of the leaf bridge and position yourself just before the two trapdoors.
2.  Look straight ahead at the line of Endermen standing on oak blocks. They will fall into the hole where you can kill them for drops.
3.  To stop the farm, look away from the middle to prevent more Endermen from spawning and make sure to kill the remaining Endermen in the hole.
4.  To collect ender pearls, simply open both trapdoors and take as many as you need from the barrel.

**TIP:** To AFK at the farm, set your autoclicker to left-click every 650 milliseconds for optimal results.

----------

### **Moss Farm**

**Location:** North-northeast side of the claim.

**Purpose:** The Moss Farm allows you to harvest large quantities of moss, moss carpet, azalea bushes, and seeds, making it perfect for building, stone clearing, or generating bone meal.

**How to Use:**

1.  Under the farm, locate the **ONLY LEVER**, which has a sign indicating that it controls the farm’s operation.
2.  To start the farm, flick the lever to **ON**.
3.  To stop the farm, flick the lever to **OFF**.

**Accessing Resources:**

-   For moss and related items (moss carpet, azalea bushes, seeds), head to the **two left-most columns of chests** at the front of the farm.
-   For bonemeal, go to the **three right-most columns of chests**.

**TIP:** Do not interact with any other redstone components at the bottom of the farm except for the lever. Avoid tampering with the composters as they recycle bonemeal back into the system.

----------

### **Tree Farm**

This farm is configured to farm all regular tree types (oak, birch, spruce, acacia, azalea, cherry, and jungle). Other wood types will be added later. The Tree Farm is very complex and requires you to follow these directions carefully.

**Location:** West of the Moss Farm.

**Purpose:** The Tree Farm is designed to help you harvest all types of wood (including Nether wood) and their respective drops by using bonemeal and TNT duplication.

**Preparation:**

1.  **Bring a shulker box** and only the items that will fit inside.
2.  **Bring at least 24 saplings** of the type of wood you wish to grow.
3.  **Bring sufficient bonemeal** for your AFK session.
4.  **Bring filler items** (e.g., iron nuggets) to fill up your inventory, ensuring that you won't pick up unwanted drops.

**Farm Setup:**

1.  Check the **first three chests** facing one direction. If there are any items left over from the previous session, feel free to take them (but don’t leave anything behind unless you’re farming the same type of wood).
2.  Check the **first three hoppers** in the water stream at the top:
    -   The **first hopper** should contain one piece of the wood type you’re farming, with the rest filled with iron nuggets.
    -   The **second hopper** should contain at least one item dropped by the tree (e.g., apples, sticks), with the rest filled with iron ingots.
    -   The **third hopper** should be similar to the second, but for a different tree drop.
3.  Locate the chest near the scaffolding that controls the TNT duper. Place your bonemeal in this chest.

**Inventory Setup:**

1.  Unload all your items into the shulker box except for the saplings, bonemeal, and filler items.
2.  **Hotbar Setup:**
    -   Slot 1: Shulker box.
    -   Slot 2: Your saplings.
    -   Offhand: Bonemeal (a stack).
    -   Fill other slots with filler items like iron nuggets.

This setup ensures the farm will only pick up bonemeal and saplings, and organize wood and drops efficiently.

**Wood-Specific Configurations:**

For specific wood types, some modifications need to be made to the redstone.

##### **Jungle Wood:**

1.  To switch the farm for **Jungle Wood**, right-click the redstone next to the lever to toggle between the dot and cross states. Set it to **cross**.
2.  Climb up the scaffolding (without touching the trapdoors) and flip the lever to close the trapdoors, so they face the sky.

##### **Normal Wood Types (Oak, Birch, Spruce, Acacia, Azalea, Cherry):**

1.  For regular wood types, right-click the redstone next to the lever to toggle it to the **dot** state.
2.  Climb the scaffolding and flick the lever to open the trapdoors (blocking the observer face).

**How to Use:**

1.  Go to the **first floor** of the farm and flick the lever next to the sign to start the TNT duper. Explosions will begin.
2.  Sneak under the scaffolding and trapdoor, then flick the **bonemeal dispenser lever** to begin dispensing bonemeal. It will only dispense when you are actively taking it.
3.  Move to the edge of the farm and hold **right-click** to plant and bonemeal the saplings. To AFK, press **F3 + T** to reload the farm and let go of right-click. You can then AFK until you run out of bonemeal.
4.  To stop the farm, release right-click to stop planting and back away from the farm, turn off the bonemeal dispenser and TNT duper.

**Accessing Your Resources:**

-   Wood: Check the **first chest** of the item sorter. If it’s full, check the **overflow chest**.
-   Tree Drops: Open chests 2 and 3. If full, check the overflow chests.

**TIP:** Always remember to take all your resources with you. If you’re helping out, make sure to empty the hopper item sorters (first slots) and leave the iron nuggets for the next person.
