I'm going to try and make this as quick as possible... I really want to share my moon picture with friends but this web app called Astrobin is so slow and my profile is in a state of existing and not existing at the same time...

*hehe... like a qubit*

Anyways, this is my first moon picture and description (with my tools) which I was going to put on Astrobin but... yeah.

Here it is, I took the picture in my background with my old DSLR camera on a Maxell tripod stand. My camera is a Canon EOS Rebel T7 with a Canon Zoom Lens EF 75-300mm 1:4-5.6 III lens attached. I connected it to my phone using the Cannon Connect app to take roughly 141 photos of the moon on August 5th, 2025 (Waxing Gibbous, approx. 91.5%).

I will probably edit this page later to add stuff but this works for now!
